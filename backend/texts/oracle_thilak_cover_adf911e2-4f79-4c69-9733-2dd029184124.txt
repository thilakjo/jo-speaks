Hey
 
Oracle
 
Team
,
 
I’m
 
Thilak
 
S
,
 
a
 
third
‑
year
 
(6th sem)
 
Electronics
 
&
 
Communication
 
Engineering
 
student
 
at
 
R.V.
 
College
 
of
 
Engineering
 
and
 
a
 
B.Sc.
 
Data
 
Science
 
undergrad
 
at
 
IIT
 
Madras
.
 
Between
 
soldering
 
STM32
 
boards
 
in
 
the
 
lab
 
and
 
hammering
 
out
 
React
 
components
 
at
 
my
 
hostel
 
desk,
 
I’ve
 
cultivated
 
a
 
passion
 
for
 
blending
 
low
‑
level
 
firmware
 
with
 
cloud
‑
powered
 
applications—and
 
I’m
 
excited
 
about
 
the
 
chance
 
to
 
bring
 
that
 
mash
‑
up
 
of
 
skills
 
to
 
Oracle’s
 
intern
 
program.
 
Why
 
Me?
 
●
 
Embedded
 
to
 
Edge:
 
I
 
built
 
a
 
Raspberry Pi–based
 
object
‑
detection
 
system
 
using
 
TensorFlow,
 
wiring
 
up
 
camera
 
modules,
 
tuning
 
GPIO
‑
driven
 
LEDs,
 
and
 
optimizing
 
model
 
inference
 
on
 
limited
 
hardware.
 
That
 
project
 
taught
 
me
 
the
 
nitty
‑
gritty
 
of
 
performance
 
constraints—and
 
made
 
me
 
dream
 
about
 
edge
‑
deployed
 
AI
 
running
 
on
 
Oracle
 
IoT
 
Cloud.
 
 
●
 
Full
‑
Stack
 
Hustle:
 
In
 
PriintIt,
 
my
 
self
‑
started
 
web
 
app,
 
I
 
owned
 
everything
 
from
 
Figma
 
wireframes
 
to
 
React
 
UI
 
to
 
Node.js/Supabase
 
backend.
 
I
 
implemented
 
Clerk
 
authentication,
 
wrote
 
SQL
 
policies
 
for
 
secure
 
data
 
access,
 
and
 
deployed
 
on
 
Vercel—so
 
I
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
ship
 
a
 
polished
 
product
 
end
‑
to
‑
end.
 
 
●
 
Collaboration
 
&
 
Leadership:
 
As
 
lead
 
organizer
 
of
 
our
 
college’s
 
hackathon
 
team,
 
I
 
mentored
 
peers
 
on
 
version
 
control,
 
code
 
reviews,
 
and
 
agile
 
sprints.
 
I’ve
 
also
 
run
 
weekly
 
study
 
groups
 
for
 
DSA
 
in
 
Java
 
and
 
C++,
 
so
 
I’m
 
comfortable
 
explaining
 
tough
 
concepts
 
and
 
bouncing
 
ideas
 
around.
 
 
●
 
Cloud
 
&
 
Curiosity:
 
I’m
 
fascinated
 
by
 
Oracle
 
Cloud
 
Infrastructure’s
 
mix
 
of
 
bare
‑
metal
 
performance
 
and
 
developer
‑
friendly
 
tooling.
 
I’ve
 
played
 
with
 
their
 
free
 
OCI
 
tier—spinning
 
up
 
VM
 
instances,
 
experimenting
 
with
 
Autonomous
 
Databases,
 
and
 
even
 
tinkering
 
with
 
Functions
 
for
 
serverless
 
workflows.
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
go
 
deeper:
 
building
 
event
‑
driven
 
pipelines,
 
optimizing
 
latency
 
for
 
IoT
 
data
 
ingestion,
 
and
 
leveraging
 
Oracle’s
 
AI
 
services
 
to
 
add
 
intelligence
 
at
 
scale.
 
What
 
I’ll
 
Bring
 
●
 
A
 
relentless
 
“get
‑
it
‑
done”
 
attitude:
 
I’m
 
just
 
as
 
happy
 
debugging
 
C
 
interrupts
 
as
 
I
 
am
 
polishing
 
CSS
 
transitions.
 
●
 
Quick
 
learning:
 
From
 
ARM
 
assembly
 
to
 
React
 
hooks,
 
I
 
pick
 
up
 
new
 
tools
 
fast
 
and
 
enjoy
 
digging
 
into
 
documentation
 
until
 
I’ve
 
hacked
 
a
 
working
 
prototype.
 
●
 
Team
 
spirit:
 
I
 
thrive
 
in
 
collaborative
 
environments,
 
whether
 
it’s
 
pair
‑
programming
 
on
 
a
 
Friday
 
night
 
or
 
sharing
 
snacks
 
during
 
a
 
morning
 
stand
‑
up.
 
Thanks
 
for
 
considering
 
my
 
application.
 
I’d
 
love
 
to
 
chat
 
about
 
how
 
my
 
blend
 
of
 
embedded
‑
firmware
 
chops
 
and
 
cloud
‑
full
‑
stack
 
passion
 
can
 
contribute
 
to
 
Oracle’s
 
next
 
wave
 
of
 
innovations.

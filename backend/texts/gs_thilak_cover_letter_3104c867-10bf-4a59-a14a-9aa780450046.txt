Hiring
 
Manager
 
 
Goldman
 
Sachs
 
 
Bengaluru
 
Office
 
Subject:
 
Application
 
for
 
Summer
 
Analyst
 
Internship
 
Dear
 
Hiring
 
Manager,
 
I’m
 
writing
 
to
 
apply
 
for
 
the
 
Summer
 
Analyst
 
Internship
 
at
 
Goldman
 
Sachs.
 
I’m
 
currently
 
in
 
my
 
second
 
year
 
of
 
Electronics
 
&
 
Communication
 
Engineering
 
at
 
R.V.
 
College
 
of
 
Engineering,
 
and
 
also
 
pursuing
 
a
 
B.Sc.
 
in
 
Data
 
Science
 
from
 
IIT
 
Madras.
 
My
 
academics
 
have
 
equipped
 
me
 
with
 
strong
 
technical
 
and
 
analytical
 
foundations.
 
My
 
interest
 
lies
 
at
 
the
 
intersection
 
of
 
finance
 
and
 
technology.
 
I’ve
 
built
 
a
 
Raspberry
 
Pi–based
 
object
 
detection
 
system
 
using
 
TensorFlow
 
and
 
developed
 
a
 
full-stack
 
web
 
application
 
called
 
PriintIt
 
using
 
React,
 
Node.js,
 
Clerk,
 
and
 
Supabase.
 
These
 
experiences
 
sharpened
 
my
 
skills
 
in
 
coding,
 
problem-solving,
 
and
 
building
 
scalable
 
systems
 
from
 
scratch.
 
Goldman
 
Sachs’
 
blend
 
of
 
innovation,
 
impact,
 
and
 
collaboration
 
excites
 
me.
 
I’m
 
eager
 
to
 
bring
 
my
 
hands-on
 
approach,
 
quick
 
learning,
 
and
 
drive
 
to
 
contribute
 
meaningfully
 
to
 
your
 
team
 
and
 
grow
 
through
 
the
 
Summer
 
Analyst
 
experience.
 
Thank
 
you
 
for
 
your
 
time
 
and
 
consideration.
 
I’d
 
be
 
thrilled
 
to
 
discuss
 
how
 
I
 
can
 
contribute
 
to
 
Goldman
 
Sachs.
 
Warm
 
regards,
 
 
Thilak

PROFILE INFO
POSITION OF RESPONSIBILITYA Raspberry Pi-based system for real-time environmental sound and
object recognition and classification using machine learning algorithms
and audio sensors
Used the TensorFlow framework to recognize objects and sounds, with
YOLO (custom) being used for images and Keras algorithm for sounds. 
Applied Model Predictive Control (MPC) and MPPT algorithms enhancing
solar energy capture through real-time adjustments.
Ensured smooth integration of the STM32 micro module with existing
solar setups, focusing on reliability and ease of maintenance capturing  
real-time solar data to maximize energy absorption.2024

## üêû Troubleshooting

- **Uploads not working?**
  - Make sure your Supabase keys are correct and RLS policies allow inserts.
  - Check that the backend is running and reachable from the frontend.
- **CORS errors?**
  - The backend allows all local dev origins by default. If deploying, update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `backend/config.py`.
- **Gemini not answering?**
  - Add your Google API key to `.env` as `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
- **Admin clear-all not working?**
  - Make sure your Supabase service role key is set in `.env` as `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.

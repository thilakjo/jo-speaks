# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jo Jo, your PDF Q&A Sidekick

Welcome to my home! I'm Thilak's little project for chatting with your PDFs, powered by Supabase, FastAPI, Vite/React, and a sprinkle of Gemini magic. If you've ever wished you could just _ask_ a document a question, you're in the right place.

---

## What's This All About?

I let you upload PDFs, then you can ask questions about themâ€”like "What's the main point of this doc?" or "When's the deadline?" I'll read, remember, and answer, all while keeping your files safe in Supabase. (And yes, I use Google Gemini for the smart stuff, but only locally for now.)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (Jo Jo Style)

**Step 1: Clone Me!**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thilakjo/jo-speaks.git && cd jo-speaks
```

**Step 2: Fire Up Docker (Easiest Way)**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

_Pro tip: No need to mess with .env filesâ€”Docker will set it up for you!_

**Step 3: Open Your Browser**

- Head to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- Upload a PDF, ask away, and watch the magic happen!

## Want to Tinker Locally? (No Docker)

1. **Set up Python & Node:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
   ```

2. **Start the backend:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn backend/api/index:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

3. **Start the frontend:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Visit:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Environment Stuff

- All the keys you need are in `.env.example` (already filled in for you!).
- If you want to use your own Supabase or Gemini keys, just edit `.env`.

---

## Endpoints (For the Curious)

- `POST /api/upload` â€“ Send me your PDFs!
- `GET /api/history` â€“ See what you've uploaded.
- `POST /api/ask` â€“ Ask me anything about your docs.
- `GET /api/health` â€“ Check if I'm feeling okay.

---

## Pro Tips

- Keep your PDFs under 50MB for the fastest answers.
- If you see "Invalid URL" errors, double-check your `.env` file.
- Want to use your own Supabase? Swap out the keys in `.env`.

---

## Changelog

- **v3.2** â€“ Gave Jo Jo a friendlier voice, made onboarding a breeze, and sprinkled in more helpful comments.
- **v3.1** â€“ Cleaned up those pesky scrollbars and added more fun Jo Jo comments.
- **v3.0** â€“ Docker support! Now anyone can run me with a single command.
- **v2.0** â€“ Gemini support for local Q&A.

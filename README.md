# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jo Jo, your PDF Q&A Sidekick

Welcome to my home! I'm Thilak's little project for chatting with your PDFs, powered by Supabase, FastAPI, Vite/React, and a sprinkle of Gemini magic. If you've ever wished you could just _ask_ a document a question, you're in the right place.

---

## What's This All About?

I let you upload PDFs, then you can ask questions about themâ€”like "What's the main point of this doc?" or "When's the deadline?" I'll read, remember, and answer, all while keeping your files safe in my cozy local folders. (And yes, I use Google Gemini for the smart stuff, but only locally for now.)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started (Jo Jo Style)

**Step 1: Clone Me!**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thilakjo/jo-speaks.git && cd jo-speaks
```

**Step 2: Fire Up Locally (Easiest Way)**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
```

**Step 3: Start the backend:**

```bash
uvicorn backend/api/index:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Step 4: Start the frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Step 5: Open Your Browser**

- Head to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- Upload a PDF, ask away, and watch the magic happen!

## Environment Stuff

- All the keys you need are in `.env.example` (already filled in for you!).
- If you want to use your own Supabase or Gemini keys, just edit `.env`.

---

## Endpoints (For the Curious)

- `POST /api/upload` â€“ Send me your PDFs!
- `GET /api/history` â€“ See what you've uploaded.
- `POST /api/ask` â€“ Ask me anything about your docs.
- `GET /api/health` â€“ Check if I'm feeling okay.

---

## Pro Tips

- Keep your PDFs under 50MB for the fastest answers.
- If you see "Invalid URL" errors, double-check your `.env` file.
- Want to use your own Supabase? Swap out the keys in `.env`.

## Changelog
